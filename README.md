Welcome to the SimCG repository!

SimCG is a Simulationcraft APL parser written in Go and was created for the
eventual purpose of creating a syntax a bit more modern and readable to write
APLs with.

# Use

Today SimCG is simply an [in-progress] APL parser. See `example.go` for a
demonstration of how it works.
